The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an executable program. The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine language). A program that translates from a low level language to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a language translator, source to source translator, or language converter. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: lexical analysis, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and code optimization. The term compiler-compiler is sometimes used to refer to a parser generator, a tool often used to help create a compiler."}}</textarea></div>
